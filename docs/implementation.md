Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Setup and Environment Configuration
Duration: 1-2 days
Tasks:
Initialize Repository:
Create a new Git repository: mkdir website-generator && cd website-generator && git init.

Add README.md with project overview.

Commit: git add . && git commit -m "Initialize repo".

Create Dockerfile:
Define a container with pre-installed Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, and a CMS.

Build and test: docker build -t website-generator:latest ..

Verify Environment:
Run a test container: docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 website-generator:latest bash.

Check /app for next.config.js, src/, components/ui/, and src/data/cms.json.

Deliverable: A working Docker image with pre-configured dependencies.
Phase 2: Template Development
Duration: 2-3 days
Tasks:
Design Templates:
Create /templates/restaurant/ with Home.tsx, About.tsx, Menu.tsx.

Create /templates/portfolio/ with Home.tsx, Projects.tsx.

Use Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI components with CMS placeholders.

Test Templates:
Manually copy a template to /app/src/app/ and run npm run dev in the container to verify rendering.

Deliverable: A set of reusable, customizable templates.
Phase 3: Agent Implementation
Duration: 3-4 days
Tasks:
Develop CodeActionAgent:
Create agent.py with methods: analyze_input, customize_template, save_image, generate_content, setup_cms, generate.

Implement logic to process inputs, save images, update CMS, and generate content.

Integrate with Templates:
Add template copying and customization logic.

Test with sample input data.

Add CMS:
Implement /src/app/api/cms/route.ts for GET/POST.

Create /src/app/cms/page.tsx for editing.

Deliverable: A functional CodeActionAgent that generates a website.
Phase 4: Testing and Optimization
Duration: 2-3 days
Tasks:
Test End-to-End:
Run the container with docker run and provide sample input via environment variable.

Verify /src contains a complete website with CMS.

Optimize Performance:
Ensure one-shot generation completes within seconds.

Minimize container image size with multi-stage builds if needed.

Debug Issues:
Handle errors (e.g., invalid inputs, image saving failures) with logging.

Deliverable: A tested, optimized website generator.
Phase 5: Deployment Preparation
Duration: 1-2 days
Tasks:
Static Export:
Add a script to export the site: npm run build && npm run export.

Test deployment to a static host (e.g., Netlify).

Dynamic Hosting:
Configure npm run dev for local testing.

Document deployment to a Node.js server or Vercel.

Deliverable: Deployment-ready code with instructions.
Timeline
Total: ~9-14 days

Milestones:
Day 2: Environment ready

Day 5: Templates complete

Day 9: Agent functional

Day 12: Tested and optimized

Day 14: Deployment ready

Risks and Mitigation
Build Failures: Use pinned versions (e.g., create-next-app@14.2.15) and log errors.

Agent Complexity: Start with basic templates and expand incrementally.

CMS Limitations: Use a simple JSON CMS initially; upgrade to Strapi if needed later.

Integration with Cursor IDE
Import Project: Open Cursor IDE, select "Import Project," and point to the website-generator directory.

Tasks View: Use Cursor’s task management to track phases (e.g., create a task for each Dockerfile step).

AI Assistance: Leverage Cursor’s AI coding features to auto-generate template files or debug agent logic.

Version Control: Commit changes regularly with git add . && git commit -m "Phase X complete".
